# JANAF thermochemical tables to NASA polynomials converter
These codes allows to generate [NASA Glenn Coefficients](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20020085330/downloads/20020085330.pdf) from JANAF (Joint Army-Navy-Air Force) [thermochemical tables](https://janaf.nist.gov/janaf4pdf.html) or any other thermochemical table formatted like the JANAF tables found on the [NIST Chemistry Notebook](https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) or your own data found by ab-initio calculations for example. The text formatting of the NASA polynimials is rather strict and can found in some [old edition of the Chemkin manual](CHEMKIN_III_manual(1996).pdf).
